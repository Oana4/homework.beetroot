# 2D random walk. A two-dimensional random walk simulates the behavior of a particle moving in a grid of points.
# At each step, the random walker moves north, south, east, or west with probability equal to 1/4,
# independent of previous moves. Write a program that takes an integer command-line argument n
# and estimates how long it will take a random walker to hit the boundary
# of a 2n-by-2n square centered at the starting point
