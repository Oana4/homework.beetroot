Task 1

The greatest number

Write a Python program to get the largest number from a list of random numbers with the length of 10

Constraints: use only while loop and random module to generate numbers

Task 2

Exclusive common numbers.

Generate 2 lists with the length of 10 with random integers from 1 to 10, and make a third list containing the common integers between the 2 initial lists without any duplicates.

Constraints: use only while loop and random module to generate numbers

Task 3

Extracting numbers.

Make a list that contains all integers from 1 to 100, then find all integers from the list that are divisible by 7 but not a multiple of 5, and store them in a separate list. Finally, print the list.

Constraint: use only while loop for iteration.
