# Some nice theory:
# Code objects are simply looks into the different aspects of a compiled function.
# A code object describes different aspects of a function, based on its byte code.
# Every function in Python has a __code__ attribute that holds its code object.
# co_nlocals â€” is the number of local variables used by the function (including arguments).
